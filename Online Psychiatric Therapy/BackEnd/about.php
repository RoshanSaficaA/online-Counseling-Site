          <p>
            Individual counseling (sometimes called psychotherapy,talk therapy,or treatment)is a process through which clients work one-on-one with a trained mental health clinician in a safe, caring, and confidential environment. Counseling allows individuals to explore their feelings, beliefs, and behaviors, work through challenging or influential memories, identify aspects of their lives that they would like to change, better understand themselves and others, set personal goals, and work toward desired change.

    <p><b>------------------------------------------</b></p>
		<p>Experiencing growth and change isn’t always easy. In childhood and adolescence, emotions can run high and small changes in routine or family life can make a big impact on a child’s mental health. Child counselling aims to help children and teenagers work through emotions and stressful times themselves so that they can develop into adults can manage daily life independently.
      These are also key foundational years. Low self-image and confidence in childhood can negatively impact future development. </p></div>
